					Prediction of Land Cover From Dense Time Series Remote Sensing Images

1.Project Description:

Problem Statement:
To study change/development in a particular land area which is important to analyze the growth and problems in particular area

Dataset:
Experimental data set is retrived from sentinel-2 hub which of location Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh and time line 01-01-2017 to 01-01-2024 with 12 points of time per year .Total 84 images experimental data image resolution:  150 m image size: (512,512)
we split the dataset from 01-01-2017  to 01-12-2022 as training dataset and from 01-01-2023 to 01-01-2023 as testing dataset

Models:
SARIMA:.SARIMA model parameters such as order (non-seasonal ARIMA order), seasonal order (seasonal order), and trend are defined.
STL-AR:1.The STL class from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal is used to decompose the time series (ts) into trend, seasonal, and residual components using Seasonal-Trend decomposition with LOESS.
DHR:This involves fitting an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model with harmonic terms (sinusoidal components) to capture seasonal patterns. Then, it generates forecast values for a specified forecast horizon using the fitted model and the generated harmonic terms.
TCN:A Sequential model is created with a TCN layer and a Dense output layer.
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.

2.Project Running:
1.Import necessary libraries and dataset
2.Data Preprocessing by calculating the EVI values
3.Preparing train data and test data
4.Building the respective models
5.Training the model
6.Making predictions and printing forecast values
7.Plotting the data between actual vs forecast
8.And calculating the metrics which includes PCC, RMSE, MAE, Accuracy
9.Finally compile and run the respective models
